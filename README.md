# Raycaster

Cool as fuck raycaster in java.

This is so slow since its cpu ill probably do some gpu stuff in the future this is like my first proper raycaster.

Theres some stupid issues with pitch and it turns into roll instead of pitch / yaw for no explainable reason please help me if you can fix this 
For some reason i cant figure out why it doesn't render the edges of faces from behind the "stair" properly like the red wall you cant see the first face for some odd reason.. unless thats what its meant to look like i have no idea.
